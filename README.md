# Lego-CollectionðŸ‘¾

This project is a web application that allows users to browse and view a collection of Lego sets.
Users can explore Lego sets by themes, view details of individual sets, and learn more about the collection. 
The application is built using Node.js and Express for the server-side, EJS for templating, and HTML/CSS for the front-end.
Here is the Published URL: https://lego-collection-iyaa.onrender.com

# Note: 
Loading time will be around 2-3 min because of the free web service feature of Render.(I deployed on Cyclic before, but it doesn't support free deployment anymore.)
